# WeatherChecker

Run this app on an iPhone 6, or an iPhone of the same size. If you do not the screen will be messed up.

I chose the Dark Sky Forecast API because it was used by other weather services, so it can be reliable. It was also easy to
use. 

The Done button will not act as the "Get me my Weather" button.

Also, I drew all the artwork on my computer. 

This will not work with Swift 3
